 # Registration Form with React and Axios

This is a registration form built using React and Axios. It allows users to create an account by providing their personal information and profile details. The form includes fields for name, phone number, gender, email address, password, description, landmark, city, and profile picture link.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you will need the following:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A code editor or IDE, such as Visual Studio Code.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install` in the terminal.

## Running the Application

1. Start the development server by running `npm start` in the terminal.
2. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Code Overview

The `Registration` component is the main component of the application. It handles the user input, form validation, and submission.

### Form State

The form state is managed using the `useState` hook. The initial state of the form is defined as follows:

```javascript
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  name: "",
  phone_number: "",
  gender: "",
  email_id: "",
  password: "",
  description: "",
  landmark:"",
  city:"",
  profile_pic: "",
  role:"",
});
```

### Form Input Handling

The `handleInputChange` function is used to handle changes in the form fields. It updates the form state with the new values entered by the user.

```javascript
const handleInputChange = (e) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
  setFormData({
    ...formData,
    [name]: value,
  });
};
```

### Form Submission

The `handleSubmit` function is used to submit the form data to the server. It uses the `axios` library to make a POST request to the `/register` endpoint.

```javascript
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  // Set isLoading to true to show the loader
  setIsLoading(true);
  e.preventDefault();

  try {
    const response = await axios.post(
      "http://localhost:4000/register
